Installation
============

If you have already downloaded textteaser, run the following
command inside this directory::

    $ python setup.py install

If you have not yet downloaded textteaser, it would be easier to use
pip::

    $ pip install textteaser

or easy_install::

    $ easy_install textteaser


Either method will install textteaser into your current environment.
